"""人物关系网: check and pack the ties between people (data/relations.json).

    python3 tools/build_relations.py [new-batch.json ...]

data/relations.json holds `links` (who taught, served, fought or wrote to whom; AI-drafted) and a `people` index
(name, years, home, period) for every person a link names, so the app can draw a tie to someone whose period file
isn't loaded. Batches given on the command line are merged in (a pair keeps one link per kind). Links naming an
unknown person or event are dropped, years are pulled inside both lifetimes, and the index is rebuilt from
data/layers/*.json. Rerun after editing people.
