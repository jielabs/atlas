# Custom data: data packs

The atlas is an engine. It supplies the world map, terrain, satellite imagery, world borders from 3000 BCE to today,
the timeline, tours, search and the UI. **Your history** (periods, events, tours and map layers) lives in a **data
pack**: a folder of JSON files with a `manifest.json`, published on your own site. Point the atlas at it with `?pack=`:

```
https://atlas.daiyip.com/?pack=https://example.org/atlas/manifest.json
https://atlas.daiyip.com/?pack=https://example.org/atlas/manifest.json&packonly=1
```

- By default the pack is **added** to the atlas's own data. Its periods become one more region, which wins inside its
  outline, and its events and tours sit beside the built-in ones.
- With `packonly=1` the pack is **shown alone**. The atlas's own events, tours, cities, per-period layers and overlays
  are left out, and so are the layer switches and ledger tabs that would be empty.

A complete working pack is in [`examples/demo-pack/`](../examples/demo-pack/). It has one period, 61 events, Paul's
three journeys as tours, two map layers and a plugin.

## A minimal pack

```
my-pack/
  manifest.json
  eras.json
  events.json
  tours.json        (optional)
```

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "atlas": 1,
  "id": "rome",
  "name": "Ancient Rome",
  "name_zh": "古罗马",
  "region": {
    "polygon": [[-10, 35], [40, 35], [40, 55], [-10, 55]],
    "view": { "center": [12.5, 41.9], "zoom": 5, "year": -44 }
  },
  "range": { "start": -753, "end": 476 },
  "data": { "eras": "eras.json", "events": "events.json", "tours": "tours.json" },
  "attribution": "Events: my sources"
}
```

## Manifest

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas` | The Atlas format the pack is written for: the lowest format that can read it, `1` unless the pack uses something newer (`2` for `data.graph`). See [Versions](#versions). |
| `id` | Lowercase letters, digits and `-`. It is also the region id, and the key the browser remembers the view under. |
| `name`, `name_zh` | Display name in English and Chinese. |
| `data.eras`, `data.events` | Required. Paths relative to the manifest. |
| `data.tours` | Optional guided tours. |
| `data.people` | Optional rulers and famous people (see [people.json](#peoplejson-rulers-and-people)). |
| `data.details`, `data.illustrations` | Optional stories and pictures for events and people (see [Stories and pictures](#stories-and-pictures)). |
| `data.graph` | Optional places a reader can follow through time, with who held them (format 2). See [places.md](places.md#packs). |
| `region.polygon` | Outline `[[lon, lat], ...]`. While the map is mostly inside it, the timeline shows the pack's periods. `region.bounds` (`[[west, south], [east, north]]`) is used as a box when there is no polygon. |
| `region.view` | First view when there is no link and no remembered view: `center`, `zoom`, `year`. |
| `range` | `{start, end}`: the years the pack's periods cover. Negative years are BCE. |
| `refs` | Optional link back to your own site. Events with `refs` and tour steps with `ref` get a link built from `url`, with `{ref}` replaced. `label` and `label_zh` are its tooltip. |
| `attribution` | Added to the map credits. |
| `note`, `note_zh` | When the pack is shown alone, this replaces the borders note in the side panel. |
| `layers` | Map overlays drawn from GeoJSON. See [plugins.md](plugins.md#layers). |
| `library` | Optional path to a shelf of packs to switch between (see [A shelf of packs](#a-shelf-of-packs)). |
| `plugins` | JavaScript modules that extend the atlas. See [plugins.md](plugins.md#plugins). |
| `basemap` | Your own ground instead of Earth's: another planet or an invented world. Only for a pack shown alone. See [Base map](#base-map). |

Text fields come in pairs: `x` in English and `x_zh` in Chinese. If the Chinese one is missing, the English one is
shown.

## eras.json: the periods

```json
{
  "range": { "start": 31, "end": 100 },
  "eras": [
    { "id": "early-church", "name": "The Early Church", "name_zh": "初期教会", "glyph": "使徒",
      "short": "Early Church", "tiny": "Chr", "start": 31, "end": 100,
      "summary": "The apostles preach from Jerusalem to Rome.", "summary_zh": "使徒从耶路撒冷一直传道到罗马。" }
  ]
}
```

Periods must follow each other with no gaps. `glyph` is the seal in the era card (one or two characters);
`glyph_en`, if given, replaces it when the atlas is in English (up to three letters). `short`
and `tiny` are the labels on the timeline when space runs out.

### Border maps

By default a pack's periods use the atlas's world border maps, so they need nothing more. A period can bring its own
maps instead, as `snapshots`, a list of GeoJSON files with the year each takes over:

```json
{ "id": "red-cliffs", "start": 208, "end": 210, "...": "...",
  "snapshots": [
    { "from": 208, "borders": "borders/sg-207.geojson", "label": "207: Cao Cao has united the north", "label_zh": "207年：曹操统一北方" },
    { "from": 209, "borders": "borders/sg-209.geojson" }
  ] }
```

Paths are relative to the manifest, and may point at the atlas's own maps on the same site
(`../../data/borders/eastern-han.geojson`). The maps are drawn like the atlas's dynasty maps: inside the East Asia
window, with the outer world map around it. Features take the shape of `data/borders/*.geojson`: `name`, `name_zh`, a
`label` point, `area`, optional `color`, and `focus: true` for the states the period is about (the rest are drawn as
neighbours). A period's `focus` list of names, if given, overrides the flags. `label` / `label_zh` describe the map in
the era card. The Three Kingdoms pack builds its maps from commandery seats with `tools/build_states.py`
(`tools/sanguo/build_borders.py`).

## events.json: dated, located events

```json
[
  { "id": "paul-at-athens", "year": 50, "level": 1, "category": "culture",
    "title": "Paul at Athens", "title_zh": "保罗在雅典",
    "place": "Athens", "place_zh": "雅典", "lat": 37.97, "lon": 23.72,
    "summary": "Paul speaks on the Areopagus.", "summary_zh": "保罗在亚略巴古讲道。",
    "refs": ["Acts.17.16-34"] }
]
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique across the pack. |
| `year`, `endYear` | When it happened (the end is optional). |
| `lat`, `lon` | Where. |
| `level` | `1` key, `2` major, `3` detail. The event filter and timeline zoom use it. |
| `category` | One of `war`, `politics`, `reform`, `rebellion`, `diplomacy`, `economy`, `culture`, `science`, `society`. |
| `title`, `place`, `summary` (+ `_zh`) | Text for the list, the map card and the story view. |
| `refs` | Optional, for the manifest's `refs` link. |
| `people` | Optional ids from `data.people`: the story shows them as chips, and each person's card lists their events. |
| `source`, `source_zh` | Optional Wikipedia pages, linked under the story. |
| `date`, `endDate` | Optional exact dates, `"1949-10-01"` or `"1949-10"`, in `year` and `endYear`; shown in place of the years. `year` stays a whole year (format 2). |
| `circa`, `year_range` | `circa: true` marks the year as approximate; `year_range: [from, to]` (format 2) gives the span it may fall in. |
| `sources` | Optional, more links after the Wikipedia ones (format 2): URLs, or `{url, title, title_zh}`. |
| `area` | Optional, a [place graph](places.md) area the event belongs to (format 2); the story links to its 地区史 card. `lat`/`lon` are still required. |
| `polities` | Optional, the countries the event involves, as [place graph](places.md) polity ids (`polity:qing`) (format 2). |
| `layers` | Optional. Map layers the Auto layers switch turns on while this event's story is open, for example `["armies", "passes"]`. `[]` turns none on. Left out, keyword rules guess. Keys: `rulers`, `people`, `armies`, `routes`, `exchange`, `spread`, `passes`, `roads`, `walls`, `clans`, `capitals`, `faith`, `inventions`. |

## tours.json: guided tours

```json
[
  { "id": "paul-first", "era": "early-church", "path": true,
    "title": "Paul's first journey", "title_zh": "保罗第一次旅行布道",
    "steps": [
      { "year": 45, "at": [36.165, 36.201], "zoom": 6.4, "event": "first-missionary-journey", "ref": "Acts.13.1-3",
        "text": "The church at Antioch sends them out.", "text_zh": "安提阿的教会差遣他们出去。" }
    ] }
]
```

Each step flies the camera to `at` (with optional `zoom`, `pitch` and `bearing`), moves the timeline to `year` and
shows `text`. `event` links the step to an event's story, and `path: true` draws the journey so far. A step's `layers`
works like an event's: the layers Auto layers turns on at that stop (without it, the linked event's, then the rules).

### Tour media: pictures, narration and music

A pack can bring the same media the atlas's own tours have: a picture per stop, a voice reading each stop's `text_zh`,
and background music per period. Name three index files and the folder their files sit in:

```json
"media": {
  "base": "https://data.atlas.daiyip.com/apps/bible/",
  "pictures": "media/pictures.json",
  "narration": "media/narration.json",
  "music": "media/music.json"
}
```

The indexes have the same shape as the atlas's own, with file names under `base`:

| File | Shape | Files in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pictures` | `{"keys": {"a:tour.<tour id>.<step>": "<image id>", "a:<event id>": …}, "images": {"<image id>": {"f": "<file>", "w": 1536, "h": 1152, "ai": "<model>"}}}` | `base/ai/` |
| `narration` | `{"<tour id>/<step>": {"Charon": "<file>", "Kore": "<file>", "h": "<CRC-32 of text_zh, 8 hex digits>"}}` | `base/narration/` |
| `music` | `{"<pack id>/<era id>": {"f": "<file>"}}` | `base/music/` |

A step is read aloud only while `h` matches its current `text_zh`, so an edited caption falls silent instead of reading
old words. Pictures are always shown as AI-generated. `base` must be on an allowed site or under the atlas's R2
`apps/` folder (see [data-updates.md](data-updates.md#layout-on-r2)), and its files need the CORS header for
atlas.daiyip.com. Each part is optional, and an atlas that predates `media` simply leaves it out, so it needs no new
format.

## Reading newer data

So that data written for a newer atlas does as little harm as possible on an older one, every reader follows the same
rules:

- **Unknown keys are ignored.** A new optional field never stops a file from loading.
- **Unknown values are shown as they are.** An event category or a person's field the page doesn't know is shown
  under its own name, not dropped. (`tools/validate.py` still reports it, since a pack is checked against one format.)
- **A field never changes meaning.** When a field needs a different shape, a new key carries it (`sources` beside
  `source`, `date` beside `year`) and the old one keeps its meaning.
- **Ids never change.** What other data, links and saved views point at stays valid. Merged places keep their old id
  ([places.md](places.md#compatibility)).
- **Whole years stay whole years.** Exact dates and uncertain ranges come in their own keys.

## Versions

One number, the **Atlas format**, versions everything in a pack: the manifest, the data files (eras, events, tours,
layers) and the [plugin API](plugins.md#the-atlas-object). The manifest's `atlas` says which format the pack is
written for.

- **Older packs keep working.** The atlas reads every format up to its own and upgrades older files as it loads them,
  so a pack never has to change just because the atlas moved on.
- **Newer packs are refused** with a message asking the visitor to reload: a page too old to understand the pack would
  otherwise show it wrongly. (If the page was merely cached, the reload fixes it.)
- **Optional extras can ask for more.** A layer or a plugin entry may carry its own `atlas`. On an older atlas it is
  skipped and the rest of the pack still opens:

  ```json
  "plugins": ["plugins/journey.js", { "src": "plugins/narrator.js", "atlas": 2 }]
  ```

The format goes up when the atlas gains something a pack may rely on, such as a new manifest key, field or file that
an older atlas would silently get wrong. Fields an older atlas can safely ignore don't raise it. Set `atlas` to the
lowest format that has everything your pack uses:

The format is numbered separately from the app. The app version (`?v=`, shown as "Atlas v230" in the map credits)
goes up with every release; the format only goes up when packs need to know, so the table below is the full list of
format changes. The credits show both, for example "Atlas v230 · data format 2".

| Format | First app version | Added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | v178 (earlier versions read format 1 only) | Everything in these pages: manifest, `eras.json`, `events.json`, `tours.json`, layers, plugins (API 1), `basemap`. |
| 2 | v230 | The [place graph](places.md): `data.graph` (JSON or JSONL with `include`), and `atlas.places` for plugins (API 2). Events: `date`, `endDate`, `year_range`, `sources`, `area`. A format-1 pack reads as before; its region is the node `region:<pack id>`. |

The atlas's own data declares its format the same way, in `data/manifest.json`.

## Base map

A pack shown alone (`packonly=1`) can replace Earth with its own ground. The [Mars pack](../examples/mars-pack/)
is a complete example: open `/?pack=examples/mars-pack/manifest.json&packonly=1`. For a step-by-step guide,
including how to make tiles from one picture, see [custom-ground.md](custom-ground.md).

```json
"basemap": {
  "earth": false,
  "background": "#0b0b10",
  "dem": { "tiles": "tiles/dem/{z}/{x}/{y}.png", "encoding": "terrarium", "maxzoom": 3 },
  "imagery": { "tiles": "tiles/img/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg", "maxzoom": 4, "name": "Viking colour", "name_zh": "海盗号影像" },
  "relief": [[-8000, "#1d2a5c"], [0, "#c9d27a"], [5000, "#d0743a"], [21000, "#ffffff"]],
  "reliefName": "Elevation", "reliefName_zh": "高程",
  "exaggeration": 0.5,
  "labels": "labels.json",
  "attribution": "Mars tiles: OpenPlanetary"
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `earth` | `false` hides everything that belongs to Earth: coastlines, rivers, lakes, old river courses, landscape names and the world borders. Leave it out to keep them (for a re-coloured Earth). |
| `dem` | Elevation tiles (XYZ, Web Mercator) for relief, hill shading and 3D. `encoding` is `terrarium` (default) or `mapbox`. Past `maxzoom` the last zoom is enlarged. Without `dem` there is no relief and no 3D. |
| `imagery` | Picture tiles (XYZ, Web Mercator). `name`, `name_zh` label it in the style menu. |
| `relief` | Colours for heights in metres, as `[height, colour]` pairs, used by the relief style. |
| `reliefName`, `reliefName_zh` | The relief style's name in the menu. |
| `background` | Colour where there are no tiles. |
| `exaggeration` | Multiplies the 3D height (default `1`). Lower it for a world with taller mountains than Earth. |
| `labels` | Place names on the ground, the same shape as `data/geo/features.json`: `{name, name_zh, kind, lon, lat, minzoom?}`, with `kind` one of `mountain`, `plain`, `plateau`, `desert`, `sea`, `lake`, `river`, `corridor`. They show with the Landscape switch. |
| `sky` | A MapLibre sky object for the 3D horizon (default: a dark sky). |
| `attribution` | Credits for the tiles. |

Tile paths are relative to the manifest. The style menu offers only the pack's own styles: its imagery and its
relief. Tiles must use XYZ numbering (row 0 at the north); if your source is TMS, flip the rows.

## Checking a pack

`tools/validate.py` checks a pack against the data format before you publish it. It needs only Python 3:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py my-pack             # the pack's folder, or its manifest.json
python3 tools/validate.py data examples/*-pack   # the atlas's own data/ and the example packs
```

```
Atlas data format 2
my-pack/manifest.json: 2 error(s), 1 warning(s)
  error: events.json paul-at-athens: unknown `category` 'religion'
  error: tours.json paul-first step 3: event 'paul-in-cyprus' does not exist
  warning: events.json saul-is-converted: `layers` has unknown key 'army'
```

**Errors** are things the atlas would refuse or show wrongly, and the command exits 1 if there are any. **Warnings**
are worth a look but break nothing. It checks:

- **Manifest**: `atlas` is a format this atlas reads (see [Versions](#versions)), `id`, `name`, `data.eras` and
  `data.events`, the shape of `region` and `range`, `refs.url` has `{ref}`.
- **Periods**: unique ids, a name, `start` before `end`, and each period starting where the one before ends (the year
  after, or the same year), inside `range`. A `glyph` of more than two characters is a warning.
- **Events**: unique ids, a whole `year` (and `endYear` not before it), `lat`/`lon` on the globe, `level` 1–3, a known
  `category`, a `title`. Unknown `layers` keys are a warning.
- **Tours**: unique ids, a title, `era` is one of the periods, every step has a `year`, `at` as `[lon, lat]` and
  `text`, and its `event` exists.
- **Layers and plugins**: ids, `type`, `years`, a per-entry `atlas`, the GeoJSON file is a FeatureCollection whose
  features have geometry and sensible `from`/`to`, plugin files exist.

The **Validate data** workflow (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs it on the atlas's own data and the example
packs for every push and pull request that changes them. A pack in another repository can run the same command
in its own CI against a checkout of the atlas.

## people.json: rulers and people

The same three lists as the atlas's own per-period files (`data/layers/<era>.json`), for the whole pack; each period
gets the reigns and lives that touch its years. With them, a pack shown alone keeps the Rulers and People tabs and
their map switches, which it otherwise hides.

```json
{
  "polities": { "Wei": { "name_zh": "曹魏", "focus": true } },
  "rulers": { "Wei": [ { "name": "Cao Pi", "name_zh": "曹丕", "title": "Emperor Wen of Wei", "title_zh": "魏文帝", "from": 220, "to": 226 } ] },
  "people": [ { "id": "zhuge-liang", "name": "Zhuge Liang", "name_zh": "诸葛亮", "born": 181, "died": 234, "show": [207, 234],
                "field": "strategist", "place": "Longzhong", "place_zh": "隆中", "lat": 32.0, "lon": 112.05,
                "known_for": "...", "known_for_zh": "..." } ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `polities` | Countries by key: `name_zh`, and `focus` for the main ones (listed first). A key that is also a `name` on the period's border map puts the reigning ruler under that label. |
| `rulers` | Reigns by country key: `name`, `title` (+ `_zh`), `from`, `to`, optional `circa`. In a handover year the later reign wins. |
| `people` | `id`, `name`, `born`, `died`, `field` (`general`, `statesman`, `strategist`, `thinker`, `poet`, `writer`, `historian`, `scholar`, `religious`, `artist`, `scientist`, `physician`, `engineer`, `explorer` or `other`), `place`, `lat`, `lon`, `known_for` (+ `_zh`). The marker shows for the life, or for `show: [from, to]` when given; a person with no `died` needs `show`. |

## Stories and pictures

`data.details` is one file of longer stories, keyed by event id, in the format of the atlas's `data/details/<era>.json`:
`story` and `story_zh` (lists of paragraphs), `why` (+ `_zh`), an optional `quote` (`zh`, `en`, `from`) and `people`
(`name`, `role` + `_zh`). Opening an event shows its story under the summary; an event without one shows the summary
alone.

`data.illustrations` is a picture index in the format of the atlas's `data/illustrations.json`: `keys` maps
`"e:<event id>"` and `"p:<person id>"` to an image id, and `images` gives each image its bucket `b`, size, credit
(`artist`, `license`, `url` of the file page) and `page`. The pictures themselves are data URLs in `<b>.json` beside the
index, loaded when first needed. The pack's index wins over the atlas's on the same key.

## A shelf of packs

Several packs on one site can be switched between from the region chip at the top left. Each manifest names the same
library file, and the chip's menu lists its entries:

```json
{ "packs": [
  { "id": "xiyouji", "name": "Journey to the West", "name_zh": "西游记", "sub": "Chapters 1–100", "sub_zh": "第1–100回",
    "color": "#c47a2c", "manifest": "xiyouji/manifest.json" },
  { "id": "sanguo", "name": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "name_zh": "三国演义", "manifest": "sanguo/manifest.json" },
  { "id": "atlas", "name": "History atlas", "name_zh": "历代地图" }
] }
```

`manifest` paths are relative to the library file; an entry with no manifest opens the atlas itself. Picking an entry
reloads the page with that pack shown alone, in the current language, so each pack keeps its own timeline, layers
and plugins. The library and its packs follow the same allowlist as any pack. This repository's shelf is
`packs/index.json`.

## Hosting and the allowlist

Pack text is put into the atlas page, so the atlas only loads packs (and plugins) from a short list of sites:
`PACK_ORIGINS` at the top of `app.js`, plus the atlas's own site and `localhost` for development. Today the list is
`atlas.daiyip.com`, `bible.daiyip.com`, `gallery.daiyip.com` and `daiyip.github.io`. You have two ways to use your own pack:

1. **Self-host the atlas.** It is a static site with no build step. Fork the repo, put your pack in a folder next to
   it (for example `packs/rome/`) and open `/?pack=packs/rome/manifest.json`. A pack on the same site always loads.
2. **Use atlas.daiyip.com.** Open a pull request that adds your site to `PACK_ORIGINS`. Your pack's files must be served
   with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (GitHub Pages does this for you).

To try a pack while you write it, serve the atlas and your pack locally:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000          # from the atlas checkout
# open http://localhost:8000/?pack=examples/demo-pack/manifest.json&packonly=1
python3 tools/validate.py examples/demo-pack   # and check it (see Checking a pack)
```

## Links into a pack

The address keeps the view, so you can link straight to a moment:

| Hash key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `y` | Year, for example `y=-44`. |
| `c` | Camera: `lon,lat,zoom,pitch,bearing`. |
| `e` | Open this event's story. |
| `tour`, `s` | Start this tour at step `s` (counting from 1). |
| `l=en` | English. |

For example: `/?pack=…/manifest.json&packonly=1#tour=paul-first&s=3&l=en`. Changing the hash reloads the atlas at the
new place. This is how a host page moves an embedded atlas (see the README).
