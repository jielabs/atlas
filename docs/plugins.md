# Plugins and map layers

A [data pack](custom-data.md) can add its own things to the map in two ways:

- **[Layers](#layers)**: GeoJSON files that the atlas draws for you. No code is needed. Use them for roads, borders,
  sites and regions.
- **[Plugins](#plugins)**: JavaScript modules that receive the map and the atlas's events. Use them for anything
  that moves or reacts, such as animations, live data or custom cards.

Each layer and plugin switch appears in a **Pack** (专题) group in the layers panel. The browser remembers each
visitor's choices for each pack.

![Demo pack: Roman roads, churches and journey playback](img/pack-demo.jpg)

The [demo pack](../examples/demo-pack/) uses both: Roman roads and churches are layers, and journey playback is a
plugin.

## Layers

List them in the manifest:

```json
"layers": [
  { "id": "roads", "name": "Roman roads", "name_zh": "罗马大道", "data": "layers/roads.geojson",
    "type": "line", "color": "#7a5230", "width": 3, "dash": [3, 1.5] },
  { "id": "churches", "name": "Churches", "name_zh": "教会", "data": "layers/churches.geojson",
    "type": "circle", "color": "#2f6f8f", "radius": 6 }
]
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Lowercase letters, digits and `-`, unique in the pack. |
| `name`, `name_zh` | The switch's label. |
| `data` | Path to a GeoJSON FeatureCollection, relative to the manifest. |
| `type` | `fill`, `line` or `circle`. If you leave it out, polygons are filled and outlined, lines are stroked and points are drawn as dots. |
| `color` | Default colour. A feature's own `color` property wins. |
| `opacity` | Fill opacity, default `0.22`. |
| `width`, `dash` | Line width in pixels and dash pattern, for example `[3, 1.5]`. |
| `radius` | Dot radius in pixels. |
| `on` | `false` starts the layer switched off. |
| `years` | `[from, to)`: the whole layer only shows in these years. |
| `atlas` | Optional. The [Atlas format](custom-data.md#versions) this layer needs; an older atlas skips it. |

### Features

```json
{ "type": "Feature",
  "properties": { "name": "Via Egnatia", "name_zh": "伊格那提亚大道", "from": -146,
                  "text": "The Roman road across Macedonia.", "text_zh": "横贯马其顿的罗马大道。",
                  "ref": "Acts.16.11-12" },
  "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[19.45, 41.32], [22.94, 40.64], [24.40, 40.94]] } }
```

| Property | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `from`, `to` | Years the feature exists, `[from, to)`. Either can be left out. As the timeline moves, the feature appears and disappears. |
| `name`, `name_zh` | Card title. A feature with a name or text opens a card when clicked. |
| `text`, `text_zh` | Card text. |
| `ref` | Adds a link to the card through the manifest's `refs`. |
| `color` | Overrides the layer colour. |

## Plugins

A plugin is an ES module listed in the manifest. Paths are relative to the manifest:

```json
"plugins": ["plugins/journey.js"]
```

An entry can also be `{ "src": "plugins/journey.js", "atlas": 2 }`: a plugin that needs a newer
[Atlas format](custom-data.md#versions) than the rest of the pack. An older atlas skips it.

It exports a setup function. The atlas calls it once, after the map has loaded:

```js
export default function setup(atlas) {
  const dots = atlas.addLayer({ id: "my-dots", name: "My dots", type: "circle",
                                data: { type: "FeatureCollection", features: [] } });

  atlas.on("year", ({ year }) => {
    dots.setData(/* GeoJSON for this year */);
  });
}
```

Plugins run inside the atlas page, so they load only from the sites a pack may come from. See
[Hosting and the allowlist](custom-data.md#hosting-and-the-allowlist). If a plugin fails to load or throws, the atlas
logs it in the console and carries on without it.

### The `atlas` object

**State** (read-only)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas.version` | The [Atlas format](custom-data.md#versions) this page reads, `2`. The plugin API is part of it. |
| `atlas.map` | The [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/) map, already loaded. |
| `atlas.maplibregl` | The MapLibre library, for markers and popups. |
| `atlas.pack` | The pack's manifest. |
| `atlas.year` | The current year (negative is BCE). |
| `atlas.era` | The current period: `{id, name, name_zh, start, end}`. |
| `atlas.lang` | `"zh"` or `"en"`. |
| `atlas.tour` | The running tour, `{id, index, steps, path}`, or `null`. |

**Events**: `atlas.on(name, fn)` returns a function that removes the handler.

| Event | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| `year` | `{year, era, eraChanged}`: the timeline moved. |
| `tour-step` | `{id, index, step, steps, path}`: a tour step started. The camera flight takes about 2.6 s. |
| `tour-end` | `{}`: the tour was closed or finished. |
| `event` | `{id, event}`: an event was opened. |
| `lang` | `{lang}`: the language changed. |
| `panel` | `{color, opacity}`: the panel colour (`auto` or `#rrggbb`) or opacity (0.2–1, `null` = built-in) changed. |
| `panelStyle` | `{style}`: the panel style changed (`classic`, `paper`, `glass`, `editorial` or `lacquer`). |

**Adding to the map**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas.addLayer(def)` | A layer as in the manifest. `data` may be a URL or a GeoJSON object, and `chip: false` gives it no switch. Returns `{on, setData(geojson), show(on), layerIds}`. |
| `atlas.addToggle(def, fn)` | A switch with no layer of its own. `def` is `{id, name, name_zh, on}`. `fn(on)` is called now and on every click. |
| `atlas.showCard(lngLat, html)` | Opens a map card. The HTML is used as is. |

**Moving the atlas**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas.setYear(year)` | Moves the timeline. |
| `atlas.setStyle(id)` / `atlas.style` / `atlas.styles` | Switches the map style (`satellite`, `terrain`, `antique`, `plain`, `dark`, `night`); the current one; all of them. |
| `atlas.startTour(id, step)` | Starts a tour (step counts from 0). |
| `atlas.openEvent(id)` | Opens an event's story. |

**Places** (format 2): the [place graph](places.md), ids as in the graph. `year` defaults to the current year.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas.places.ready()` | Resolves once the graph has loaded; the others return nothing useful before. |
| `atlas.places.get(id)` | The node, or `null`. |
| `atlas.places.path(id, year)` | Where it lies: `[id, parent, …, group]`. |
| `atlas.places.held(id, year)` | Who held it: `[{id, polity, share}]`, a map name's `id` resolved to its `polity` id. |
| `atlas.places.claims(id, year)` | The polity ids claiming it. |
| `atlas.places.open(id)` | Opens an area's 地区史 card and selects it. |

**Helpers**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `atlas.text(en, zh)` | Picks the visitor's language. `atlas.text(obj, "name")` reads `obj.name` or `obj.name_zh`. |
| `atlas.url(path)` | A URL next to the plugin file. |
| `atlas.fetchJSON(path)` | Loads a JSON file next to the plugin. |

## Example: journey playback

[`examples/demo-pack/plugins/journey.js`](../examples/demo-pack/plugins/journey.js) traces each leg of a journey with a
moving marker while the tour's camera flies. It is 30 lines long:

```js
export default function setup(atlas) {
  const empty = { type: "FeatureCollection", features: [] };
  const leg = atlas.addLayer({ id: "journey-leg", chip: false, data: empty, type: "line", color: "#e0a526", width: 5 });
  const head = atlas.addLayer({ id: "journey-head", chip: false, data: empty, type: "circle", color: "#e0a526", radius: 8 });
  let frame = 0, enabled = true;

  const clear = () => { cancelAnimationFrame(frame); leg.setData(empty); head.setData(empty); };
  atlas.addToggle({ id: "journey", name: "Journey playback", name_zh: "行程回放" }, (on) => { enabled = on; if (!on) clear(); });

  atlas.on("tour-step", ({ index, steps, path }) => {
    clear();
    if (!enabled || !path || index === 0) return;
    // ...animate from steps[index - 1].at to steps[index].at with requestAnimationFrame
  });
  atlas.on("tour-end", clear);
}
```

Try it at `/?pack=examples/demo-pack/manifest.json&packonly=1#tour=paul-first&s=1`.

## Embedding

With `?embed=1` the atlas shows only the map and a small period label. The panels, the timeline and the tour card are
hidden, and tours frame their stops for the whole map. Use it when the host page shows the story itself, beside the
map.

Add `&mini=1` for a small inset map (beside a tour card, say): a tour step frames the leg from the last stop to
this one rather than flying in to the stop, and the period label and map buttons go too.

`&hide=` hides parts of an embedded atlas, as a comma-separated list: `era` (the period label), `controls` (zoom,
compass and full screen), `credits` (the data credits button; show your sources elsewhere if you hide it) and `span`
(the time beside a tour leg). For example `?embed=1&hide=era,controls`.

The Simple styles (`style=plain`, `style=night`) draw land as a shape and load no elevation tiles, so they are the
lightest choice for an embedded map.

To move an embedded atlas without reloading it, let your pack's plugin listen to the host page with `postMessage`,
and report back what the visitor does on the map:

```js
export default function setup(atlas) {
  if (window.parent === window) return;                 // not embedded
  const HOST = "https://example.org";                   // your app's site
  addEventListener("message", (e) => {
    if (e.source !== window.parent || e.origin !== HOST) return;
    if (e.data.type === "tour") atlas.startTour(e.data.id, e.data.step);
    if (e.data.type === "year") atlas.setYear(e.data.year);
  });
  atlas.on("tour-step", ({ id, index }) => window.parent.postMessage({ type: "tour-step", id, index }, HOST));
}
```

Check the sender's origin on every message, and name your own site as the target when you post back. The Bible
reader's [bridge plugin](https://github.com/daiyip/interactive-bible/blob/main/atlas/plugins/bridge.js) is a complete
example: the reader starts tours and pins a verse's places, and the atlas sends back tour steps and clicked verses.
