**An interactive 3D history map, from 3000 BCE to today.** Pick a year and the map shows that moment's borders,
cities and events. Take guided tours, read the stories behind events, and switch on layers for armies, roads, faith,
inventions and more. It works in English and Chinese.

- **The whole world, 3000 BCE to today.** Borders come from Cliopatria (Seshat) and historical-basemaps, with 124 world maps. The timeline follows the
  civilisation you are looking at: over Europe it shows Europe's periods, over India India's. About 3,500 events,
  204 guided tours, and rulers and people for 14 regions, plus trade routes and the spread of faiths, techniques and crops.
- **China in depth.** Xia to Qing, with battles, roads, walls, elites and long event stories.
- **3D terrain and satellite imagery** need no API keys. Overview tiles come with the site (served from its own data host); zoom in and sharper
  terrain (about 30 m) and 10 m imagery load on demand.
- **An engine for your own history.** Any site can show its own periods, events, tours, map layers and plugins on the
  atlas, and embed the result.

## Use it with your own data

Put your history in a **data pack**, a folder of JSON files with a `manifest.json`, and point the atlas at it:

```
https://atlas.daiyip.com/?pack=https://example.org/atlas/manifest.json&packonly=1
```

The atlas provides the map, terrain, borders, timeline, tours and search. Your pack provides:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Periods, events and tours** | `eras.json`, `events.json`, `tours.json`. See [docs/custom-data.md](docs/custom-data.md). |
| **Map layers** | GeoJSON roads, regions or sites that appear and disappear with the years. No code needed. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md#layers). |
| **Plugins** | JavaScript modules that get the map and the atlas's events, for animations and anything interactive. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md#plugins). |
| **Your own ground** | Another planet or an invented world instead of Earth: your own imagery, elevation and place names. `tools/make_tiles.py` turns one picture into tiles. See [docs/custom-ground.md](docs/custom-ground.md). |

![A pack with its own layers and a journey playback plugin](docs/img/pack-demo.jpg)

[`examples/demo-pack/`](examples/demo-pack/) is a complete pack: Paul's journeys, Roman roads and churches as
layers, and a plugin that animates each leg of a journey. To try it, open
`/?pack=examples/demo-pack/manifest.json&packonly=1#tour=paul-first&s=1` on a local copy.

A pack can even bring its own world: [`examples/mars-pack/`](examples/mars-pack/) replaces Earth with Mars (its own
elevation, imagery and place names) and follows the landers from 1971 to today. Open
`/?pack=examples/mars-pack/manifest.json&packonly=1`. See [docs/custom-ground.md](docs/custom-ground.md).

### Embed it in your app

The atlas is a plain web page, so it embeds with an `iframe`:

```html
<iframe id="atlas" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0" allow="fullscreen"
  src="https://atlas.daiyip.com/?pack=https://example.org/atlas/manifest.json&packonly=1#tour=paul-first&s=1&l=en">
</iframe>

<script>
  // Move the embedded atlas: change the hash and it reloads at that place.
  const atlas = document.getElementById("atlas");
  const base = atlas.src.split("#")[0];
  function showTour(id, step) { atlas.src = `${base}#tour=${id}&s=${step}&l=en`; }
  function showYear(year, lon, lat, zoom = 6) { atlas.src = `${base}#y=${year}&c=${lon},${lat},${zoom},45,0&l=en`; }
</script>
```

| Address | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `?pack=<manifest URL>` | Loads your pack. Add `&packonly=1` to hide the atlas's own data. |
| `?lang=en` / `zh` | Interface language. |
| `?style=<id>` | Map style: `satellite` (default), `terrain`, `antique`, `plain` (flat, no relief or 3D), `dark` (terrain, dark) or `night` (simple, dark). Overrides the visitor's own choice. |
| `?embed=1` | Only the map and a small period label: no panels, timeline or tour card. For a host page that tells the story itself and moves the map through a plugin (see [Embedding](docs/plugins.md#embedding)). |
| `#y=<year>&c=<lon>,<lat>,<zoom>,<pitch>,<bearing>` | Opens at a year and camera. Negative years are BCE. |
| `#tour=<id>&s=<step>` | Starts a tour at a step (counting from 1). |
| `#e=<event id>` | Opens an event's story. |

Your pack's map layers and plugins come along automatically, because they are part of the pack.

**Allowed sites.** The atlas puts pack text into its page and runs pack plugins, so on atlas.daiyip.com it loads packs
only from the sites in `PACK_ORIGINS` in [`app.js`](app.js). To use your own site, either open a pull request that
adds it, or self-host the atlas: it is a static site, and a pack on the same site always loads. Your files need
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (GitHub Pages sends it). See
[docs/custom-data.md](docs/custom-data.md#hosting-and-the-allowlist).

## Run it locally

It is a static site with no build step:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daiyip/atlas && cd atlas
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Opening `index.html` straight from disk won't work, because browsers block `fetch()` of local files.
